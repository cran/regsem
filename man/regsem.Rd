\arguments{
\item{model}{Lavaan output object. This is a model that was previously
run with any of the lavaan main functions: cfa(), lavaan(), sem(),
or growth(). It also can be from the efaUnrotate() function from
the semTools package. Currently, the parts of the model which cannot
be handled in regsem is the use of multiple group models, missing
other than listwise, thresholds from categorical variable models,
the use of additional estimators other than
ML, most notably WLSMV for categorical variables. Note: the model
does not have to actually run (use do.fit=FALSE), converge etc...
regsem() uses the lavaan object as more of a parser and to get
sample covariance matrix.}

\item{lambda}{Penalty value. Note: higher values will result in additional
convergence issues. If using values > 0.1, it is recommended to use
mutli_optim() instead. See \code{\link{multi_optim}} for more detail.}

\item{alpha}{Mixture for elastic net. Not currently working applied.}

\item{gamma}{Additional penalty for MCP and SCAD}

\item{type}{Penalty type. Options include "none", "lasso", "ridge",
"enet" for the elastic net,
"alasso" for the adaptive lasso
and "diff_lasso". diff_lasso penalizes the discrepency between
parameter estimates and some pre-specified values. The values
to take the deviation from are specified in diff_par. Two methods for
sparser results than lasso are the smooth clipped absolute deviation,
"scad", and the minimum concave penalty, "mcp".}

\item{data}{Optional dataframe. Only required for missing="fiml" which
is not currently working.}

\item{optMethod}{Solver to use. Recommended options include "nlminb" and
"optimx". Note: for "optimx", the default method is to use nlminb.
This can be changed in subOpt.}

\item{gradFun}{Gradient function to use. Recommended to use "ram",
which refers to the method specified in von Oertzen & Brick (2014).
The "norm" procedure uses the forward difference method for
calculating the hessian. This is slower and less accurate.}

\item{hessFun}{Hessian function to use. Recommended to use "ram",
which refers to the method specified in von Oertzen & Brick (2014).
The "norm" procedure uses the forward difference method for
calculating the hessian. This is slower and less accurate.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Whether to parallelize the processes?}

\item{Start}{type of starting values to use. Only recommended to use
"default". This sets factor loadings and variances to 0.5.
Start = "lavaan" uses the parameter estimates from the lavaan
model object. This is not recommended as it can increase the
chances in getting stuck at the previous parameter estimates.}

\item{subOpt}{Type of optimization to use in the optimx package.}

\item{longMod}{If TRUE, the model is using longitudinal data? This changes
the sample covariance used.}

\item{pars_pen}{Parameter indicators to penalize. If left NULL, by default,
all parameters in the \emph{A} matrix outside of the intercepts are
penalized when lambda > 0 and type != "none".}

\item{diff_par}{Parameter values to deviate from. Only used when
type="diff_lasso".}

\item{LB}{lower bound vector. Note: This is very important to specify
when using regularization. It greatly increases the chances of
converging.}

\item{UB}{Upper bound vector}

\item{par.lim}{Vector of minimum and maximum parameter estimates. Used to
stop optimization and move to new starting values if violated.}

\item{block}{Whether to use block coordinate descent}

\item{full}{Whether to do full gradient descent or block}

\item{calc}{Type of calc function to use with means or not. Not recommended
for use.}

\item{max.iter}{Number of iterations for coordinate descent}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for coordinate descent}

\item{solver}{Whether to use solver for coord_desc}

\item{solver.maxit}{Max iterations for solver in coord_desc}

\item{alpha.inc}{Whether alpha should increase for coord_desc}

\item{step}{Step size}

\item{momentum}{Momentum for step sizes}

\item{step.ratio}{Ratio of step size between A and S. Logical}

\item{nlminb.control}{list of control values to pass to nlminb}

\item{missing}{How to handle missing data. Current options are "listwise"
and "fiml". "fiml" is not currently working well.}
